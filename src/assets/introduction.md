# Self Introduction

Hi, my name is She Yu Fei, I come from Zhengzhou, Henan province. Right now, I am studying for my master's degree
at University of Science and Technology of China, major in software engineering. 
I expect to graduate in June, this year.

I got my bachelor's degree from Yunnan University, major in software engineering also.
In my senior year, I had my first internship experience as a front-end web developer, 
mostly working on a custom component library based on the React.js ecosystem.

After rethinking of my career as a software engineer and re-judging my capabilities,
I believe that I have much more to show in the software industry, so I need a master's degree
to go for the top-tier opportunities provided by the industry leaders. 

Using only 4 months of preparation, I managed to pass the post-graduate entrance exam.
After one year of study in grad-school, I got my second internship experience in Tencent Technology,
and it lasts for about one year. In Tencent, I mostly worked on tool-programming according to the requirements
of my team. Due to the lack of full-time opportunity of the company and the approaching of the graduation,
I had to leave the job and started to prepare for the thesis defense.

As a developer, I really enjoy the process of creating high-quality solutions for others and for myself.

That's all about myself, thanks for your listening.
